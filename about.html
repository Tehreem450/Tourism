  <h1 style="font-size:40px;margin:0px;color:purple;">Tourism</h1><hr>
  <p>Tourism is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating,
 and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours. The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally,
 in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and
 staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours,
 business and other purposes".<br>
 Tourism can be domestic (within the traveller's own country) or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing
 implications on a country's balance of payments.<br><br>
 In 1994, the United Nations identified three forms of tourism in its Recommendations on Tourism Statistics:<br><br>
 - Domestic tourism, involving residents of the given country traveling only within this country<br>
 - Inbound tourism,[29] involving non-residents traveling in the given country<br>
 - Outbound tourism, involving residents traveling in another country</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:30px;margin-bottom:0px;color:purple;">Significance Of Tourism</h1><hr>
  <p>The tourism industry, as part of the service sector, has become an important source of income for many regions and even for entire countries.
 The Manila Declaration on World Tourism of 1980 recognized its importance as "an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct
 effects on the social, cultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies, and on their international relations."<br><br>
 Tourism brings large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for goods and services needed by tourists, accounting as of 2011
 for 30% of the world's trade in services, and, as an invisible export, for 6% of overall exports of goods and services. It also generates opportunities
 for employment in the service sector of the economy associated with tourism.<br><br>
 The hospitality industries which benefit from tourism include transportation services (such as airlines, cruise ships, trains and taxicabs);
 lodging (including hotels, hostels, homestays, resorts and renting out rooms); and entertainment venues (such as amusement parks, restaurants,
 casinos, shopping malls, music venues, and theatres). This is in addition to goods bought by tourists, including souvenirs.<br>
 On the flip-side, tourism can degrade people and sour relationships between host and guest.</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:30px;margin-bottom:0px;color:purple;">World Tourism Statistics And Rankings</h1><hr>
  <h1 style="font-size:30px;margin-bottom:0px;color:purple;">Total volume of cross-border tourist travel</h1>
  <p>International tourist arrivals reached 1.035 billion in 2012, up from over 996 million in 2011, and 952 million in 2010. In 2011 and 2012,
 international travel demand continued to recover from the losses resulting from the late-2000s recession, where tourism suffered a strong slowdown
 from the second half of 2008 through the end of 2009. After a 5% increase in the first half of 2008, growth in international tourist arrivals moved
 into negative territory in the second half of 2008, and ended up only 2% for the year, compared to a 7% increase in 2007. The negative trend intensified
 during 2009, exacerbated in some countries due to the outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus, resulting in a worldwide decline of 4.2% in 2009 to 880 million
 international tourists arrivals, and a 5.7% decline in international tourism receipts.</p></div>
